🧠 Prompt Intelligence & Optimization Platform

An interactive Prompt Engineering and Analytics Platform that evaluates, explains, improves, and tracks AI prompts using structured metrics, explainability, domain-aware optimization, and visual dashboards.

This project demonstrates prompt engineering skills, analytical thinking, and real-world AI tooling using Python and Streamlit.

🚀 Features
🔍 Prompt Evaluation

Evaluates prompts using multiple quality dimensions such as clarity, relevance, and instruction adherence.

Calculates a total prompt quality score for comparison.

🧬 Prompt DNA Analysis

Breaks prompts into structural components:

Role

Task

Constraints

Style

Helps understand why a prompt performs well or poorly.

💡 Explain-Why Scoring

Provides human-readable explanations for prompt scores.

Improves transparency and explainability (XAI).

🚨 Prompt Failure Simulator

Detects:

Vague prompts

Conflicting instructions

Missing constraints

Hallucination risk

Warns users before prompt execution.

🔁 Auto Prompt Optimization

Automatically rewrites prompts to improve quality.

Achieves measurable improvements across iterations.

🌐 Domain-Aware Optimization

Adapts prompts based on selected domain:

General

Education

Software Development

Healthcare (with safety disclaimers)

Marketing

💰 Cost vs Quality Analysis

Estimates token usage and execution cost.

Identifies the most cost-efficient prompts.

🧾 Prompt Version Control (Prompt Git)

Tracks prompt evolution across versions.

Stores scores, explainability metrics, and timestamps.

Visualizes improvement trends.
